  The simplest form of RNN network generated is:

  However, a few other options are available:

  An initial state can be provided.
  If the sequence_length vector is provided, dynamic calculation is performed.
  This method of calculation does not compute the RNN steps past the maximum
  sequence length of the minibatch (thus saving computational time),
  and properly propagates the state at an example's sequence length
  to the final state output.

  The dynamic calculation performed is, at time t for batch row b,
    (output, state)(b, t) =
      (t >= sequence_length(b))
        ? (zeros(cell.output_size), states(b, sequence_length(b) - 1))

      a tensor of appropriate type and shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state.  Required if

  This function is functionally identical to the function `rnn` above, but
  performs fully dynamic unrolling of `inputs`.

  Unlike `rnn`, the input `inputs` is not a Python list of `Tensors`.  Instead,
  it is a single `Tensor` where the maximum time is either the first or second
  dimension (see the parameter `time_major`).  The corresponding output is
  a single `Tensor` having the same number of time steps and batch size.

  The parameter `sequence_length` is required and dynamic calculation is
  automatically performed.

  Args:
    cell: An instance of RNNCell.
    inputs: The RNN inputs.
      If time_major == False (default), this must be a tensor of shape:
        `[batch_size, max_time, cell.input_size]`.
      If time_major == True, this must be a tensor of shape:
        `[max_time, batch_size, cell.input_size]`.
    sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`.
    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.  This must be
      a tensor of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size x cell.state_size]`.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state.  Required if
      initial_state is not provided.
    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
      and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
      time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
      while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
    swap_memory: Swap the tensors produced in forward inference but needed
      for back prop from GPU to CPU.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors.
      If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
      If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
      Using time_major = False is a bit more efficient because it avoids
      transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
      most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
      accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.
